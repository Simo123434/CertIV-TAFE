# Homework
Write code, including a header with description, author etc, to ask people if they want a cup of tea or coffee, then milk or sugar etc. You can make as much detail as you want.  
They can have either of tea or coffee, but not both.  
They can have both milk or sugar, with a maximum of 3 sugars. Any more and they are told the doctor said no.  
Bonus: Maybe offer different milks?  
At the end you need to repeat the order to them.Â
